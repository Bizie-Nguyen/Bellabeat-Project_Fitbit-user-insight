This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit's users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits. Srsen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.
